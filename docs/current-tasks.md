# Current Tasks - Budget Book

## How to Use (Team Coordination)
- Each agent reads this file at session start
- Claim a task by writing your name in the `Owner` field
- Update status: `TODO` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `DONE`
- Pull before editing, commit after updating
- Only edit files in YOUR ownership scope
